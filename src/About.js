<p className="about">
    Hailing from Goa(India). I am a Software Developer with proficient grasp in both Front end and Server-side Development.<br></br>
    Experienced with Modern Technologies such as JAVA 8, JavaScript, JDBC. Curious and enthusiastic in learning new things.<br></br>
    Curiosity is what makes a person think different, and I think learning even a small thing as it seem can make a big difference.
